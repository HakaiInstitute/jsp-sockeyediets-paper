# Sockeye diets and zooplankton biomass

All data were collected in the field as part of the Hakai Institute Juvenile Salmon Program (https://doi.org/10.21966/e5c1-c396) using methods outlined in Hunt et al. 2018 (https://npafc.org/wp-content/uploads/Public-Documents/2018/1788Canada.pdf)

Raw data, processed data, and code scripts underpinning the article "Migration timing affects the foraging ecology of Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks in coastal waters of British Columbia, Canada".

Zooplankton data were collected using horizontal surface tows of a 250 micron 50 cm diameter zooplankton net. Stomach contents were dissected and identified in the laboratory using methods outlined in 'Migration timing affects the foraging ecology of Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks in coastal waters of British Columbia, Canada.
